## Helpers in Shelley

Your `implementer`, `verifier` and `adversary` helpers are subagents you start
with your subagent tool. A subagent sees neither this conversation nor the VM
notes, so begin every subagent's first message by telling it to read
`~/.config/shelley/AGENTS.md` (the VM notes) and its role file,
`~/.claude/agents/implementer.md`, `verifier.md` or `adversary.md`, and to
follow both. Ignore the front matter in the role files. It's for claude, but an
adversary must still not edit files. Then give it the task and all the context
it needs, and ask for the role file's report when it's done. Use only GPT
models: leave the subagent's model unset so it runs on yours, or pick a GPT
model no weaker than yours, and never give it lower reasoning than your own.
Use a new subagent for each fresh look rather than reusing one that has
already seen the work.
